# Try BDD Integration Testing Journey
This project shares hands-on experiences and practical tips for building Integration Tests using **Cucumber**, **Spring Boot**, and **WireMock**.


## Cucumber + Spring Boot Integration
- **Why**: To reuse the same repository and service layer as developers.
- **Benefit**: Easily load the real Spring `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Component` into Cucumber tests.
- **Result**: Share common business use cases between developers and testers.

## Understanding Gherkin
- Gherkin is a **business-readable, domain-specific language**.
- It defines behavior in a structured format: `Given - When - Then`.
- Gherkin's real purpose is **communication first**, testing second.

## Hands-on Scenarios

### 1. Basic Gherkin + WireMock (Java)
- WireMock run by java code.
- Cucumber feature files drive Java test execution.

### 2. Example Data + Testcontainers (Docker)
- Use Gherkin `Example` for flexible input.
- WireMock run inside `Testcontainers`.
- Dynamic port binding.
- Scenario Outline with Examples for multiple test cases.

### 3. DataTable + WireMock Standalone (External)
- WireMock run standalone.
- Use Gherkin `DataTable` for flexible input.


## Lessons Learned

- **Testing should focus on behavior or business case, not infrastructure.**
- **Gherkin helps align business, testers, and developers.**
- **WireMock Usage Approaches**
  - **Standalone WireMock**
    - Separates infrastructure concern from test logic.
    - Useful when you want mock servers managed externally (not tied to Java process).
    - Supports independent server startup, easier for parallel and large-scale tests.
  - **WireMock Control by Code (Dynamic Stubbing)**
    - Allows dynamic creation of stubs inside test code without depending on static files.
    - Increases flexibility for scenarios where request/response are not fixed.
  - **WireMock + Testcontainers**
    - Makes setup clean and reliable.
    - Manages container lifecycle during test execution.
    - Suitable for isolated and reproducible integration tests.
- **Test Data and Responses**
  - Centralizes input/output data outside Java code (e.g., external JSON, YAML, CSV files).
  - Improves readability and maintainability of tests.
  - Reduces duplication and simplifies updates when test data changes.



At the beginning of any journey, there is no absolute right or wrong.
We make the best decisions based on the situation, and refine them as we move forward.
Continuous improvement is a part of the journey â€” and that's how real progress happens.
